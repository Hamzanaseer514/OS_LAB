- - # Task 2: Setting up Compilers in Virtual Box Machine

    **Step 1**

    Execute the following commands in the terminal of your Virtual Box Machine to install the required compilers:
  
    ```
    bashCopy codesudo apt-get install gcc
    sudo apt-get install g++
    ```
  
    These commands will ensure the installation of both the GCC compiler for C and the G++ compiler for C++ in your Virtual Box machine.
  
    **Step 2**
  
    After completing the installations, proceed to create files in your text editor and follow the instructions below:
  
    ## For C++
  
    - To compile: `g++ -o obj test.cpp`
    - To run: `./obj`
    - Check the output on the command prompt
  
    ## For C
  
    - To compile: `gcc -o obj test.c`
